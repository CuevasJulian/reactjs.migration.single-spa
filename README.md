# ðŸš€ Welcome good vibes!

This project was a test about react migration to single-spa application
using rewired without webpack, however for some reason that i cant understand, when i was trying merge single-spa utils with config from 'overrides function' by rewired didnt work was i expect, so i decided resolve implement webpack 5 to avoid incompabilities.

This repo contain app migration so take this points:

1) if you run the repo you will get an white page with the microservice not an usable component

```
npm run start
```

2) micro front end not require an execute order to be functional, once you execute single-spa container or this first doesnt matter. 

3) remember execute npm start in the single-spa container app (https://github.com/CuevasJulian/single-spa.container.apps) to watch final result. 

Good vibes!
